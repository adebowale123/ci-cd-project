GitHub: GitHub is a version control system that is used to track changes to code. This allows multiple engineers to 
work on the same code base at the same time without accidentally overwriting each other's changes.

Jenkins: Jenkins is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) server that automates the build, test, 
and deployment of code. This allows developers to release new features and bug fixes more frequently and reliably.

Terraform: Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure. 
This allows engineers to define their infrastructure in code, which makes it easier to reproduce and manage.

The automated solution that I contributed to uses these three tools to create an AWS Quiz application that is 
serverless and scalable. This means that the application does not require any servers to run, which can save costs. 
The application is also scalable, so it can be easily increased or decreased in size to meet demand.

The solution also improves the reproducibility, reliability, and maintainability of the application. 
This is because the code is stored in GitHub, which makes it easy to track changes and revert to previous versions 
if necessary. The solution also uses Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment process, which reduces the 
risk of errors.

Overall, the automated solution that I contributed to is a valuable tool that can be used to create, manage, 
and deploy applications more efficiently and reliably. It can also help to reduce costs and meet business demands.
